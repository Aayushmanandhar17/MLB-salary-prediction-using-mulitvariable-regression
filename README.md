# MLB-salary-prediction-using-mulitvariable-regression
In this project, I predicted the average amount of salary a MLB team needs to have to gain certain amount of success. 
This project also helps to understand the correlation between the average salary, league and win percentage .
For this project, I have accessed some raw data on relating teams, salary, league , wins and losses in a season. 
The source of the raw data is attached in the end of the page. The prediction process includes data cleaning, visualization, evaluation, correlation and finally regression


The project was created using HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, Flask and Python.  
For this project I have used various libraries that include pandas, numpy, matplotlib, sklearn, and seaborn.
